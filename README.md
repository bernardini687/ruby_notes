# Notes I take while learning Ruby

As I'm on the quest of learning Ruby&mdash;for the time being mainly from [this tutorial](https://www.udemy.com/learn-to-code-with-ruby-lang/) by [Boris Paskhaver](https://github.com/paskhaver)&mdash;I'd like to save my notes here, in order to practice Git and push myself to go back to them and make them presentable.
